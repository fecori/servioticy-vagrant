servioticy-vagrant
==================

Puppet is used to setup and launch all the needed components to run the servioticy API


##Requirements
You need to install the following vagrant plugin: vagrant-puppet-install

The procedure is:

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-puppet-install`

##Running  the instance

Now we are ready to run

`vagrant up --provision`


You can then login into the instance running:

`vagrant ssh`

##Notes

- The provision script handles either the startup of the services, so use
`vagrant up --provision` when starting the VM.

- If you use Windows as your host system, note that you may encounter issues with the End-of-Line codification (CRLF in Windows vs LF in Unix/OSX). To avoid problems, use the following command in your git configuration (assuming you are not a developer committing code) before cloning this repository
`git config --global core.autocrlf false`


##Credits

This Vagrant box is a complete refactor on an initial version developed by Luca Capra at CREATE-NET.
